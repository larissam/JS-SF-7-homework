[Homework table](#weekly-homework) is updated weekly.


#### How To Use This Repo
This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/javascript_development``` folder. 3. Create a directory in the ```JS-SF-7-homework``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```JS-SF-7-homework/Sasha-svodnik```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's github name. :)
4. For each homework add your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your personal directory. Example for homework #2: `JS-SF-7-homework/Sasha-svodnik/hw_2/hubot.js`

Example of how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- javascript_development/
        |-- JS-SF-7-homework/
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- hw_1/
                    |- bottlesOfBeer.js
                    |- randAddressGenerator.js
                |-- hw_2/
                    |- hubot.js
                |-- hw_3/
                |-- hw_4/
                |-- hw_5/
        |-- JS-SF-7-resources/ (class repo)
